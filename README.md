Project Title: Phonebook App
Project Overview:
This project is a responsive Phonebook Application built with React on the front-end and Node.js on the back-end. The app allows users to manage their contacts, including adding, editing, and deleting contact information such as name, phone number, and email. Users can also mark contacts as "favorites" for easier access. The interface is designed to be fully responsive, adapting to different screen sizes for an optimal user experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

Key Features:
Responsive Design: The app uses modern CSS techniques (flexbox, media queries) to ensure that it is fully responsive and user-friendly on various devices.
Contact Management: Users can add new contacts, edit existing ones, and delete them as needed. Contacts can also be marked as favorites for quick access.
Favorite Feature: Users can toggle favorite contacts using a checkbox, and the status is visually represented with a star icon.
Interactive UI: The app features smooth transitions and hover effects for an enhanced user experience.
Backend and Database:
Backend: The server is built with Node.js using Express to handle API requests.
